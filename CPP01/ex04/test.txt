This is a test file for the sed-like replacement program.
This line contains the word "apple", which we might want to replace.
Another line where "apple" appears twice: apple apple.
Here's a different word: banana.
Some special characters: $@#&*.
Let's try a line with multiple occurrences of different words:
apple banana apple orange apple grape.
End of the test file.
